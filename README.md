## A simple portfolio site template

This page served as a template for a previous personal portfolio site.

It helped me understand some strong fundamentals of flex.

* Flex is applied on the navbar and the other sections of the page.
* Displaying some sections of the page in the default flex direction and some others in the column direction.
